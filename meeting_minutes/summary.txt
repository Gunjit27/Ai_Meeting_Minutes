FinTech Plus reported stellar Q2 2023 earnings with $125 million in revenue (25% YoY increase), a 58% gross profit margin, $37.5 million EBITDA (30% margin), and $16 million in net income.  Growth is attributed to a high-yield savings product line, a new robo-advisor platform, and investments in asset-backed securities and corporate bonds.  The company boasts strong financials ($1.5 billion in total assets, $600 million in equity), a healthy debt-to-equity ratio (1.5), and a decreasing customer acquisition cost coupled with increasing lifetime value (LTV/CAC = 3.5x).  Risk management is robust, with a 99% confidence level in their VaR model.  Q3 revenue is projected at $135 million (8% QoQ growth) driven by blockchain and AI solutions.  The upcoming IPO of FinTech subsidiary PayPlus is expected to raise $200 million.
