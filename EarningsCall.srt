00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Good afternoon everyone and welcome to FinTech Plus Sync's second quarter 2023

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,400
earnings call. I'm John Doe, CEO of FinTech Plus. We've had a stellar Q2 with a

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,580
revenue of 125 million, a 25% increase year over year. Our gross profit margin

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,640
stands at a solid 58% due in part to cost efficiencies gained from our scalable

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,520
business model. Our EBITDA has surged to 37.5 million translating to a

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,760
remarkable 30% EBITDA margin. Our net income for the quarter rose to 16

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,560
million which is a noteworthy increase from 10 million in Q2 2022. Our total

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,920
addressable market has grown substantially thanks to the expansion of

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,520
our high yield savings product line and the new robo advisor platform. We've been

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,080
diversifying our asset backed securities portfolio investing heavily in

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,880
collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities.

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,080
We've also invested 25 million in AAA rated corporate bonds enhancing our risk

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,440
adjusted returns. As for our balance sheet total assets reached 1.5 billion

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,800
with total liabilities at 900 million leaving us with a solid equity base of

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,160
600 million. Our debt to equity ratio stands at 1.5, a healthy figure considering our

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:37,120
expansionary phase. We continue to see substantial organic user growth with

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,440
customer acquisition cost dropping by 15% and lifetime value growing by 25%.

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:51,920
Our LTV CAC ratio is at an impressive 3.5 x.

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,800
In terms of risk management we have a value at risk model in place with a 99%

20
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,160
confidence level indicating that our maximum loss will not exceed 5 million in the next

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,920
trading day. We've adopted a conservative approach to managing our leverage and have

22
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,520
a healthy tier one capital ratio of 12.5%. Our forecast for the coming quarter is

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,960
positive. We expect revenue to be around 135 million and 8% quarter over quarter

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,840
growth driven primarily by our cutting edge blockchain chain solutions and AI

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,080
driven predictive analytics. We're also excited about the upcoming IPO of our

26
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,840
fintech subsidiary pay plus which we expect to raise 200 million significantly

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,600
bolstering our liquidity and paving the way for aggressive growth strategies. We

28
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,760
thank our shareholders for their continued faith in us and we look forward to an even

29
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,920
more successful Q3. Thank you so much.
