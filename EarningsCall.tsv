0	5920	Good afternoon everyone and welcome to FinTech Plus Sync's second quarter 2023
5920	12400	earnings call. I'm John Doe, CEO of FinTech Plus. We've had a stellar Q2 with a
12400	20580	revenue of 125 million, a 25% increase year over year. Our gross profit margin
20580	25640	stands at a solid 58% due in part to cost efficiencies gained from our scalable
25640	33520	business model. Our EBITDA has surged to 37.5 million translating to a
33520	38760	remarkable 30% EBITDA margin. Our net income for the quarter rose to 16
38760	45560	million which is a noteworthy increase from 10 million in Q2 2022. Our total
45560	48920	addressable market has grown substantially thanks to the expansion of
48920	55520	our high yield savings product line and the new robo advisor platform. We've been
55520	60080	diversifying our asset backed securities portfolio investing heavily in
60080	64880	collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities.
64880	70080	We've also invested 25 million in AAA rated corporate bonds enhancing our risk
70080	77440	adjusted returns. As for our balance sheet total assets reached 1.5 billion
77440	82800	with total liabilities at 900 million leaving us with a solid equity base of
82960	90160	600 million. Our debt to equity ratio stands at 1.5, a healthy figure considering our
90160	97120	expansionary phase. We continue to see substantial organic user growth with
97120	103440	customer acquisition cost dropping by 15% and lifetime value growing by 25%.
103440	111920	Our LTV CAC ratio is at an impressive 3.5 x.
114240	120800	In terms of risk management we have a value at risk model in place with a 99%
120800	126160	confidence level indicating that our maximum loss will not exceed 5 million in the next
126160	131920	trading day. We've adopted a conservative approach to managing our leverage and have
131920	139520	a healthy tier one capital ratio of 12.5%. Our forecast for the coming quarter is
139520	144960	positive. We expect revenue to be around 135 million and 8% quarter over quarter
144960	149840	growth driven primarily by our cutting edge blockchain chain solutions and AI
149840	156080	driven predictive analytics. We're also excited about the upcoming IPO of our
156080	161840	fintech subsidiary pay plus which we expect to raise 200 million significantly
161840	167600	bolstering our liquidity and paving the way for aggressive growth strategies. We
167600	171760	thank our shareholders for their continued faith in us and we look forward to an even
171760	179920	more successful Q3. Thank you so much.
