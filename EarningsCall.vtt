Good afternoon everyone and welcome to FinTech Plus Sync's second quarter 2023

00:05.920 --> 00:12.400
earnings call. I'm John Doe, CEO of FinTech Plus. We've had a stellar Q2 with a

00:12.400 --> 00:20.580
revenue of 125 million, a 25% increase year over year. Our gross profit margin

00:20.580 --> 00:25.640
stands at a solid 58% due in part to cost efficiencies gained from our scalable

00:25.640 --> 00:33.520
business model. Our EBITDA has surged to 37.5 million translating to a

00:33.520 --> 00:38.760
remarkable 30% EBITDA margin. Our net income for the quarter rose to 16

00:38.760 --> 00:45.560
million which is a noteworthy increase from 10 million in Q2 2022. Our total

00:45.560 --> 00:48.920
addressable market has grown substantially thanks to the expansion of

00:48.920 --> 00:55.520
our high yield savings product line and the new robo advisor platform. We've been

00:55.520 --> 01:00.080
diversifying our asset backed securities portfolio investing heavily in

01:00.080 --> 01:04.880
collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities.

01:04.880 --> 01:10.080
We've also invested 25 million in AAA rated corporate bonds enhancing our risk

01:10.080 --> 01:17.440
adjusted returns. As for our balance sheet total assets reached 1.5 billion

01:17.440 --> 01:22.800
with total liabilities at 900 million leaving us with a solid equity base of

01:22.960 --> 01:30.160
600 million. Our debt to equity ratio stands at 1.5, a healthy figure considering our

01:30.160 --> 01:37.120
expansionary phase. We continue to see substantial organic user growth with

01:37.120 --> 01:43.440
customer acquisition cost dropping by 15% and lifetime value growing by 25%.

01:43.440 --> 01:51.920
Our LTV CAC ratio is at an impressive 3.5 x.

01:54.240 --> 02:00.800
In terms of risk management we have a value at risk model in place with a 99%

02:00.800 --> 02:06.160
confidence level indicating that our maximum loss will not exceed 5 million in the next

02:06.160 --> 02:11.920
trading day. We've adopted a conservative approach to managing our leverage and have

02:11.920 --> 02:19.520
a healthy tier one capital ratio of 12.5%. Our forecast for the coming quarter is

02:19.520 --> 02:24.960
positive. We expect revenue to be around 135 million and 8% quarter over quarter

02:24.960 --> 02:29.840
growth driven primarily by our cutting edge blockchain chain solutions and AI

02:29.840 --> 02:36.080
driven predictive analytics. We're also excited about the upcoming IPO of our

02:36.080 --> 02:41.840
fintech subsidiary pay plus which we expect to raise 200 million significantly

02:41.840 --> 02:47.600
bolstering our liquidity and paving the way for aggressive growth strategies. We

02:47.600 --> 02:51.760
thank our shareholders for their continued faith in us and we look forward to an even

02:51.760 --> 02:59.920
more successful Q3. Thank you so much.
